## scope
- target audience: developers who want to try braid for issue tracking

- keep it concise but complete

## suggested sections

- installation (quickest path)
- initializing in a repo
- creating your first issue
- basic workflow: start → work → done
- viewing and filtering issues
- next steps / where to learn more

## output
