## Problem

Two commands exist but aren't in the README:

1. **brd commit** - commits .braid changes with auto-generated message
2. **brd tui** - interactive terminal UI for issue management

Users can't discover these features.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add `brd commit` to command list in README
- [ ] Add `brd tui` to command list in README
- [ ] Brief description of what each does
- [ ] Consider adding screenshot of TUI
